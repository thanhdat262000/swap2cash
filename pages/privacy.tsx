            When you engage in cryptocurrency transactions through the S2C Website, we collect transaction information
            on the purchase or sale of cryptocurrencies, or other transaction-based information that you generate or
            that is connected to your account. This transaction information will be used to provide you with reports and

            Be aware that cryptocurrencies are not necessarily truly anonymous. Generally, the balance and transaction
            history of a public cryptocurrency address is publicly available. Any person who can match your public
            cryptocurrency address to other information about you may be able to identify you from a blockchain
            transaction. For example, certain information published on a blockchain can be connected to other
            information about you that another person may have. In addition, it may also be possible to identify other
            information about you through blockchain data analysis tools and techniques. As part of our anti-fraud,
            anti-money laundering and security measures, we may conduct blockchain data analysis to collect and process
            information about you. By accessing or using the S2C Website, you acknowledge and agree that we can do so.
